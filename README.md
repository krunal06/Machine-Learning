Fraud analysis has been an emerging research topic in recent years. With the growth of shopping needs, payment methods are also becoming advanced to provide ease of purchase. credit card is becoming the preferred payment method day by day. The scope of this work will be to utilize and analyze data available from the previous transactions of customers and analysis transactions to examine whether it is a fraud or non-fraud transaction. My major focus will be finding the best suitable techniques to recognize fraudulent activities. In this research, I used the already available dataset to perform my experiments. I will use different machine learning algorithms like the random forest, decision tree, logistic regression, knn, and XGBoost to compare and find the best solution with a high AUC score. Additionally, I will consider not only the accuracy of the algorithm but also the F1 score to determine the best results because of an unbalanced dataset.
